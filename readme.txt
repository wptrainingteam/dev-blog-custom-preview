Adds a "Social Card Preview" option to the editor Preview dropdown, showing how a post will look when shared on X.

== Description ==

Social Card Preview adds a menu item to the editor's Preview dropdown. When clicked, it opens a modal showing a mock preview of how the current post will appear as an X card, including the featured image, title, excerpt, and domain.

The preview reads directly from the editor store, so it updates in real time as you edit — no need to save first.

A "Share on X" button lets you open the X share dialog with the post URL and title pre-filled.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `social-card-preview` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Open any post in the editor and click the Preview dropdown to see the new "Social Card Preview" option.
